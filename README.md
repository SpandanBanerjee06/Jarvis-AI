This is all the files required to run Jarvis properly.
Jarvis is a personal voice assistant AI hosted on the web using LiveKit
Jarvis can fetch weather reports, send mails, and even search things up online, and hold conversationsin most languages.
It can be scaled up to be an android app as well
It can access and process real-time camera input 

STEPS:
1. Make files of the same name in a python environment in any editor (I used VS Code)
2. Install the libraries in the "requirements.txt" file
3. Install additional files and integrations from "agent.py"
4. Paste all of the codes in their respective files
5. Run the agent and enable outside connections
6. Connect it through LiveKit Playground website and enjoy!
